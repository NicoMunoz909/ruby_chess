# Ruby Chess
My implementation of a chess game to be played on console for The Odin Project Curriculum.

Lacking the implementation of Stalemate and draw proposal.

Planning on adding those features alongside other, like showing captured pieces on the side of the board, and refactring the whole code but I feel like it is in an OK working state to move on with the curriculum
